## Tasks
- [x] Browse the wall and choose the event - *Simple task*
- [x] Apply filters to the events - *Medium task*
- [x] Reset the interests of the platform - *Hard task* 

## Contextual informations

### **Introduction**
“SpaceCom” is a conjunctional abbreviation of the two words **“Space”** and **“Community”**.

With **“Space”**, we intend to provide an area with all the necessary informations that will help our targeted party in their integration process. 

With **“Community”**, we plan on building a bridge between international students and their new societies in hopes of unifying the diversity in a community into a single one.
 
The main goal of our app is to provide a platform for international students, to find events and activities that will help them integrate into their new societies. New activities are suggested to the users based on the previously inserted ones: the artificial intelligence that powers the application learns from the user feedback to suggest more appropriate activities.

## **About the Mid-Fi prototype**

Through our Mid-Fi prototype, starting from the registration the user can simulate to select his interests related to the activities and events that he wants to attend.\
After the login or the interests selection the user can browse through the events and activities that are happening in their area.
There is also the possibility to filter the events based on their preferences according to the tasks.

Since we are working on a medium fidelity prototype, we were not able to implement all the possible interactions (like the selection of the different interests and the AI suggestions), all the possible feedbacks (through animations and popups) and the final design of the app.

## **Main features**

### Initial setup

- **Signup page**: the registration phase in which the user inserts its general informations, like sex, country, language etc...

- **Interests selection**: the user selects his interests. After this selection, the user is redirected into more specific page where new interests are proposed. After finishing the process, the user is redirected to the home page.

### General usage

- **Login page**: Once the user signed up, he can access the application by inserting his credentials.

- **Home page**: After the login is set, events are displayed on the home page based on the previously selected interests done in the signup process. 
The user can like, dislike or show more informations about a specific event.

- **Filters**: The user can filter events based on price, date, time and event type. During the filter selection process, the user can reset all the previous choices and can remove any previously applied filter. After the filters are applied, the user is redirected back to the home page where only the events that meet the specified criteria are shown.

### Application settings

- **Settings page**: In the settings page the user has the possibility to change some fields like the password, language, location, etc...

- **Reset interests**: From the settings page, the user has the possibility to reset the previously inserted interests. After the user starts the process, the application asks him to select its interests just like in the initial setup phase.

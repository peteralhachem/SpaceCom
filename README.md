# SpaceCom

**SpaceCom** is a conjunctional abbreviation of the two words “Space” and “Community”.

With **“Space”**, our team intends to provide an area with all the necessary information that will help international students in their integration process. With **“Community”**, we plan on
building a bridge between international students and their new societies in hopes of unifying
the diversity in a community into a single one.

In this project, we tackle the concurrent problem of having sparse information
over different platforms that may render new incomers confused over credibility, availability
and authentication of these informations, and in order to solve this inquiry, we present, in this
report, a centralized platform that includes:  groups, events, help, gatherings and other useful
tools for easing the integration process of internationals.
